IAM:

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS services and resources for your users.

It allows you to create and manage AWS users and groups.
You can grant or deny permissions to AWS resources.
It enables secure access management both for human users and applications (programmatic access).

Think of IAM as the gatekeeper of your AWS environment.

Key Components of IAM:

######A. Users
Represents a person or an application that interacts with AWS.
Each user has:
Username
Security credentials:
Password (for AWS Management Console)
Access keys (for programmatic access)
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Example: subbareddy user with programmatic access to S3.

########B. Groups
A collection of IAM users.
Makes it easier to assign permissions collectively rather than individually.

Example: Create a group Developers and attach AmazonS3FullAccess policy; all users in this group inherit these permissions.

#######C. Roles
Roles are similar to users but without permanent credentials.
Used for AWS services, EC2 instances, Lambda functions, or external accounts to assume temporary access.

Example:  An EC2 instance running a script that needs to access an S3 bucket. You can attach a role to the EC2 instance instead of using access keys.

#####D. Policies
JSON documents that define permissions.

Two main types:
Managed Policies – Predefined by AWS (e.g., AdministratorAccess, AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess).
Inline Policies – Custom policies attached to a specific user, group, or role.

Types of Access in IAM:

IAM supports two types of access:

#########AWS Management Console Access
Login via web browser using username/password.
Optional MFA adds extra security.

######## Programmatic Access
Access via AWS CLI, SDKs, or APIs.
Requires Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.

IAM Best Practices

#Use Least Privilege Principle
Only grant permissions required to perform a task.
#Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Adds extra security to your account.
#Avoid Root Account Usage
Root account has full privileges; only use for account setup.
#Use Roles for EC2 and Lambda
Avoid hardcoding access keys in applications.
#Rotate Credentials Regularly
Change passwords and access keys periodically.
#Monitor with AWS CloudTrail
Track all IAM actions and detect unauthorized activity.

1)What is the difference between IAM roles, users, and policies?

How to answer (short version):
| Component  | Definition                                           | Example                         |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **User**   | Permanent identity for a person/app with credentials | Developer `subbareddy`          |
| **Role**   | Temporary identity assumed by trusted entity         | EC2 accessing S3 bucket         |
| **Policy** | JSON document defining permissions                   | `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess` policy |

Key point: Roles are for temporary access; policies define permissions; users have permanent credentials.


2)What is the difference between a managed policy and an inline policy?

Managed Policy: Reusable policy that can be attached to multiple users, groups, or roles. Can be AWS-managed or customer-managed.
Example: AdministratorAccess, AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess.

Inline Policy: Policy attached to a specific user, group, or role, and exists only for that entity.
Example: Custom policy giving access to a specific S3 bucket bottle1234567890.

Key point: Managed policies are reusable; inline policies are tightly bound to a single identity.
