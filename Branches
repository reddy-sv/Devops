##Create a new branch:
git branch <branch-name>

##Create a new branch and switch to it
git checkout -b <branch-name>

##List all branches (Local branches):
git branch

##List all branches (including remote branches):
git branch -a

##List all remote branches:
git branch -r

##Show the current branch you're on:
git branch --show-current

##Delete a local branch:
   (If the branch has been merged into the current branch or another branch, you can delete it)
git branch -d <branch-name>

  (If the branch hasn’t been merged, Git will warn you, and if you still want to delete it, use -D instead of -d to force the deletion)
git branch -D <branch-name>

##Delete a remote branch:
git push origin --delete <branch-name>

##Merge another branch into the current branch:
git merge <branch-name>

##Merge with Conflict:
If there are conflicts between branches, Git will indicate where the conflicts are in the files. You’ll need to manually resolve them by editing the files. After resolving conflicts:
git add <resolved-file>
git commit

##Rename the current branch:
git branch -m feature/old-feature-name feature/new-feature-name

##View recent commits on another branch:
git log <branch-name>

##Compare two branches:
git diff <branch1>..<branch2>

##Push a branch to a remote repository:
After creating a new branch locally, you can push it to your remote repository (e.g., GitHub):
git push origin <branch-name>

##Push a new branch and set it to track the remote branch:
git push -u origin <branch-name>

##Pull the latest changes from a remote branch:
To pull changes from a remote branch to your local branch:
git pull origin <branch-name>
