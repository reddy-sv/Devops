### Providers
Plugins that allow Terraform to interact with APIs of different platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP, VMware, etc.).

Eg:

provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-north-1"
}


### Resources
Actual infrastructure components (VMs, networks, etc.) that Terraform creates.

Eg:

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "mybucket" {
  bucket = "my-demo-bucket"
}


### Variables
Used to make configurations dynamic and reusable.

Eg:

variable "instance_type" {
  default = "t2.micro"
}

>>>>>>> You are creating a variable named instance_type.
>>>>>>> If you don’t manually provide a value, Terraform will use the default value — "t2.micro".

Example in a Terraform resource:

resource "aws_instance" "myserver" {
  ami           = "ami-0aa78f446b4499266"
  instance_type = var.instance_type
}

var.instance_type will automatically take the value from your variable definition.
If no other value is provided, it uses the default "t2.micro".

### State File
A .tfstate file stores the real-world mapping of your resources.
Terraform uses it to know what exists and what needs to change.
