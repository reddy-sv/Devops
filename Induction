Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp.
It allows you to define, provision, and manage infrastructure across cloud providers (like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) and on-premises environments using a simple, declarative configuration language called HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language).

Terraform:

Terraform lets you describe your infrastructure using configuration files.
It then automatically:

Creates the resources (servers, networks, databases, etc.),
Manages them, and
Destroys them when not needed.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> You just tell Terraform what you want, and it figures out how to make it happen.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC):

Traditionally, system administrators had to manually create and configure infrastructure — such as virtual machines, networks, and storage — through consoles or scripts.
Infrastructure as Code solves this by letting you:

Define infrastructure in code files.
Automate deployment.
Track changes in version control (like Git).
Ensure consistency across environments (dev, test, prod).

Terraform is one of the most popular IaC tools.
