####### 1) Maven Build Lifecycle

Maven follows a standardized build lifecycle that defines a sequence of phases. 
Each phase is responsible for a specific task, such as compiling code or packaging the project. 
Understanding the lifecycle is essential for configuring builds in Jenkins and other CI/CD tools.

Maven Build Phases:

1)Validate: Validates the project’s structure and configuration (ensures that the pom.xml is correct).
2)Compile : Compiles the source code.
3)Test    : Runs unit tests using testing frameworks like JUnit or TestNG.
4)Package : Packages the compiled code into a JAR/WAR/EAR file (depending on the project).
5)Verify  : Performs additional verification on the packaged code, such as integration tests.
6)Install : Installs the packaged code into the local repository (e.g., ~/.m2/repository) for use by other projects.
7)Deploy  : Deploys the packaged artifact to a remote repository (e.g., Nexus or Artifactory) so that it can be used by other environments or projects.

Common Commands for Maven Build Lifecycle:

mvn clean install          # Clean the project and install to the local repository
mvn clean package          # Clean and package the code into an artifact (e.g., JAR)
mvn test                   # Run unit tests
mvn deploy                 # Deploy the artifact to a remote repository
mvn verify                 # Verify the artifact and tests


######## 2) pom.xml (Project Object Model)

The pom.xml is the configuration file for Maven, and it's crucial for setting up your build environment, managing dependencies, and configuring plugins.

Key Sections in pom.xml:

Dependencies       : Specifies external libraries or modules required by the project.
Plugins            : Defines plugins that will be used for tasks like compiling, testing, packaging, and deploying the project.
Repositories       : Specifies the repositories where Maven can find and download dependencies (e.g., Maven Central or custom repositories like Nexus).
Build Configuration: Defines settings for the build process, such as the output directory, resources to include/exclude, and other project-specific configurations.

Example pom.xml:
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>

    <groupId>com.example</groupId>
    <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>

    <dependencies>
        <!-- Example dependency -->
        <dependency>
            <groupId>junit</groupId>
            <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
            <version>4.12</version>
            <scope>test</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>

    <build>
        <plugins>
            <!-- Example Maven plugin configuration -->
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>3.8.1</version>
                <configuration>
                    <source>1.8</source>
                    <target>1.8</target>
                </configuration>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
</project>


############# 3) Dependency Management

One of Maven’s strongest features is dependency management. 
Maven automatically resolves and downloads the required libraries for the project. 
It supports both transitive dependencies (dependencies of dependencies) and direct ones.

How Dependency Management Works:
Dependencies are specified in the <dependencies> section of the pom.xml file.
Maven will automatically download these dependencies from repositories like Maven Central or other configured repositories.
Maven ensures that the correct version of each dependency is used, avoiding conflicts.

Example Dependencies in pom.xml:
<dependencies>
    <!-- Example of a direct dependency -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-core</artifactId>
        <version>5.3.8</version>
    </dependency>

    <!-- Example of a test dependency -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
        <artifactId>junit-jupiter-api</artifactId>
        <version>5.7.1</version>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>

################## 4) Plugins

Maven's plugins allow you to extend its functionality. 
Plugins are responsible for tasks like compiling code, running tests, building Docker images, deploying to Kubernetes, and more.

Common Maven Plugins:

Maven Compiler Plugin: Compiles the source code.
Maven Surefire Plugin: Runs unit tests.
Maven JAR Plugin     : Packages the compiled code into a JAR.
Maven Docker Plugin  : Builds Docker images from Dockerfiles.
Maven Deploy Plugin  : Deploys artifacts to repositories (e.g., Nexus, Artifactory).

============================================================================================================================================
Maven to handle the build, testing, and packaging of the application.
JUnit (or another testing framework) for running unit tests.
Maven compiles the code, runs tests, and creates the build artifact (e.g., JAR/WAR file).
After Maven successfully packages the application into a JAR/WAR file, the artifact can be stored in an artifact repository like Nexus or Artifactory.
This allows other parts of the pipeline (or different projects) to reuse the artifact.
