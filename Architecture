Docker follows a client–server architecture consisting of three main layers (components):
Docker Client >>>>>>>>>>>>>→ Docker Host (Daemon) >>>>>>> → Docker Registry

1) Docker Client:

The user-facing interface (CLI, GUI or SDK) you use to talk to Docker. Examples: docker CLI, Docker SDKs, Portainer UI.

What it does (real time):
You run commands (docker build, docker run, docker push). The client translates them into API requests and sends them to the Docker daemon (usually via the Unix socket /var/run/docker.sock or TCP REST API).

2) Docker Host / Docker Daemon (dockerd):

The background service (Docker Engine) running on a physical or virtual machine that carries out all Docker work.

What it does (real time):
Listens for client API requests, builds images, pulls/pushes to registries, creates and manages containers, sets up networks and volumes, enforces isolation.

3) Docker Registry — (Docker Hub, ECR, ACR, GCR):

A storage and distribution system for Docker images. Can be public (Docker Hub) or private (AWS ECR, Azure ACR, Google GCR, self-hosted Harbor).

What it does (real time):
Stores image layers and manifests. When docker pull is invoked, the daemon downloads image layers. When docker push is invoked, the client/daemon uploads layers.
