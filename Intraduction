Docker:

Docker is a containerization platform that allows you to package your application and all its dependencies (code, libraries, runtime, config, etc.) into one lightweight unit called a container.

Images:>>> “The Blueprint”

A Docker image is a read-only template that contains everything needed to run your app —OS, libraries, dependencies, code, environment variables, etc.

Containers:>>> “The Running Instance”

A container is a running instance of a Docker image — isolated, lightweight, and fast.
It’s like launching a virtual mini-environment from that image.

### “Image = Class / Template”
### “Container = Object / Running Instance”

Volumes:>>> “Persistent Storage”

Containers are temporary. When they die, their data is gone. So we use volumes to keep data even after container deletion.

Networks:>>> “Communication Bridge”

When you have multiple containers (e.g., app + DB), they need to talk to each other.

Registry:>>> “Image Warehouse”

This is where your built images are stored and shared — either publicly or privately.

### Public: Docker Hub
### Private: AWS ECR, Azure ACR, GCP GCR
