RDS:

Amazon RDS is a managed relational database service provided by AWS.
It allows you to run and manage relational databases in the cloud without worrying about:
>Hardware provisioning
>Database setup
>Patching
>Backups
>Scaling
RDS supports multiple database engines, like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, SQL Server, and Amazon Aurora.
=========================================================================================================================
Key Features of RDS:

#Managed Service
 AWS handles maintenance tasks like backups, patching, and monitoring.
#Scalability
 Vertical scaling: Increase instance size or storage.
 Horizontal scaling: Read replicas for read-heavy workloads (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Aurora).
#High Availability
 Multi-AZ Deployment: Automatically creates a standby instance in another AZ.
 Automatic failover in case the primary DB fails.
#Automatic Backups
 Daily automated snapshots and transaction logs.
 Point-in-time recovery available.
#Security
 VPC Isolation: Run RDS in a private subnet.
 Encryption at rest and in transit: Using AWS KMS and SSL/TLS.
 IAM integration: Control access to RDS operations.
#Monitoring
 CloudWatch metrics for CPU, storage, connections, read/write IOPS.
 ===================================================================================================================
Supported Database Engines:

#MySQL – Open-source, widely used.
#PostgreSQL – Advanced open-source DB with rich features.
#MariaDB – Fork of MySQL, open-source.
#Oracle – Enterprise database with licensing options.
#SQL Server – Microsoft relational database.
#Amazon Aurora – AWS’s high-performance MySQL/PostgreSQL compatible database.
==========================================================================================================================
RDS Deployment Options:

1)Single-AZ Deployment
Database runs in one availability zone.
Less expensive, but no automatic failover.

2)Multi-AZ Deployment
Database has a primary and standby instance in different AZs.
Automatic failover for high availability.

3)Read Replicas
Scales read-heavy workloads.
Can be in the same region or cross-region.
===========================================================================================================================
Example 1: Web Application Database
A web app needs a MySQL database.
Use RDS MySQL Single-AZ for dev/test.
Use Multi-AZ for production to ensure uptime.
Backup is automatic, and monitoring is through CloudWatch.

Example 2: Read-Heavy Reporting
Analytics reports generate high read load.
Create read replicas to offload reads from primary DB.
Aurora or PostgreSQL is ideal for low-latency read performance.

Example 3: Cross-Region Disaster Recovery
Primary DB in us-east-1.
Read replica in us-west-2 for DR and analytics.
Can promote replica to primary in case of disaster.
