Kubernetes:
Kubernetes is an orchestration platform for containers.
It automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

Orchestration:
Orchestration refers to the process of automating the management, coordination, and arrangement of complex systems and workflows.
In the context of computing and IT, orchestration involves automating tasks like provisioning, deploying, scaling, and managing infrastructure and applications.

K8s Architecture Overview:

Master Node: The control center (API Server, Scheduler, Controller Manager) that makes decisions about the cluster (e.g., scheduling Pods).
Worker Nodes: These are the machines that run your containers (Pods). They communicate with the Master Node.

Kubernetes Components:

Control Plane:(Master Node)
API Server: Communicates with the client and all other components. It’s the "gateway" to the cluster.
Scheduler: Decides on which Node a Pod should run.
Controller Manager: Ensures the desired state of the system is achieved.
Etcd: Stores all cluster data (state of the cluster, configurations, etc.)

Node Components:
Kubelet: Ensures that containers are running in Pods.
Kube Proxy: Manages the network rules for services.
Container Runtime: The software that runs containers (e.g., Docker, containerd).
