Git Fetch
Purpose:

git fetch downloads changes from the remote repository to your local repository, but does not merge them automatically.
It updates your remote tracking branches (like origin/main), letting you see what has changed without touching your working branch.

#git fetch origin
=======================================================

Git Pull
Purpose:

git pull is a shortcut for git fetch + git merge (or git fetch + git rebase, if configured).
It fetches changes and automatically merges them into your current branch.

#git pull origin main
